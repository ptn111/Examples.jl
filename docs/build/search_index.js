This approach makes it easier to compare diffs and track files in Git compared to entire Jupyter notebooks.  It also allows us to set up CI testing for the tutorials to ensure that they produce the expected output  and donâ€™t suffer from bit rot over time.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Examples.jl","title":"Examples.jl","text":"The base files are present in the script folder inside a subfolder of the relevant category.
